LUFOSS
======

__Lund University Fund for Open Source Software__

## Purpose

Open Source Software (OSS) is not only changing our society, but a great way to learn about software development and to get a track record as a junior developer. LUFOSS gives scholarships to persons that contribute to OSS projects with significant utility and impact. Nominees can be students, doctoral candidates, and software developers in their early careers.

## Objectives

The activities of LUFOSS and the scholarships given shall support these general objectives:

  * to encourage open source activities among students, doctoral candidates, and young software developers in their early careers
  * to encourage the industry in the Öresund region to use and contribute to open source
  * to initiate exchange between students working with OSS and the Öresund OSS industry

## Process

The LUFOSS nomination commitee decides about scholarships based on proposals that are assessed in relation to the criteria below. Anyone can nominate candidates by opening an issue in this repo.

## Criteria 

The main criteria for the grant are:

* **Utility** The utility of the OSS contribution is assessed in relation to the potential future benefit to end users, other OSS projects, businesses and society.
* **Impact** The impact is assessed in relation to existing proof of, e.g., downloads, usage and recognition by end users, other OSS projects, businesses and society.  
* **Öresund Connection** Nominees should have a connection to the Öresund area (aka The Greater Lund Region). 

The criteria are used to assess both persons and publically hosted open source repositories using these [guidelines](https://github.com/lunduniversity/lufoss/blob/master/assessment-guidelines.md).
