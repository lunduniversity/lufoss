#Lund University Fund for Open Source Software

## Purpose

Open Source Software (OSS) is not only changing our society, but a great way to learn about software development and to get a track record as a junior developer. LUFOSS gives scholarships to persons that contribute to OSS projects with significant utility and impact. Nominees can be students, doctoral candidates, and software developers in their early careers.

## Objectives

The activities of LUFOSS and the scholarships given shall support these general objectives:

  * to encourage open source activities among students, doctoral candidates, and young software developers in their early careers
  * to encourage the industry in the Öresund region to use and contribute to open source
  * to initiate exchange between students working with OSS and the Öresund OSS industry

## Process

The LUFOSS nomination commitee decides about scholarships based on proposals that are assessed in relation to the criteria below. Anyone can propose candidates at [www.lufoss.org](http://www.lufoss.org)

## Criteria 

The main criteria for the grant are:

* **Utility** The utility of the OSS contribution is assessed in relation to the potential future benefit to end users, other OSS projects, businesses and society.
* **Impact** The impact is assessed in relation to existing proof of, e.g., downloads, usage and recognition by end users, other OSS projects, businesses and society.  
* **Öresund Connection** Nominees should have a connection to the Öresund area.

The criteria are used to assess both persons and publically hosted open source repositories using these [guidelines](http://xxx)

**Observe that projects to be evaluated must have an open source license!**
